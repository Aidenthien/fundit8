- **No Real-Time Tracking**: Donors cannot monitor the progress and impact of their donations in real-time
- **High Administrative Costs**: Conventional donation platforms charge significant fees, reducing the actual amount reaching causes 
- **Limited Accountability**: Charities lack standardized reporting mechanisms to demonstrate impact and build donor confidence

## üîó **The Graph**

FundIt8 utilizes **The Graph** for querying blockchain data related to donors, campaigns, and other key metrics. The Graph enables efficient querying and indexing of blockchain data for faster and easier access to the platform's data.

- **Subgraph URL**:  
  [https://api.studio.thegraph.com/query/105145/fund-it-8/version/latest](https://api.studio.thegraph.com/query/105145/fund-it-8/version/latest)
  
- **Subgraph Repository**:  
  [https://github.com/johnp2003/fund-it-8](https://github.com/johnp2003/fund-it-8)

The Graph helps us query donor information and manage the leaderboard effectively, ensuring accurate and real-time data retrieval for our campaigns and donor engagement.
